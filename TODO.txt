add delete book form to delete individual books.
first time login form is broken (keeps showing up?) (is this actually password migration fail? I think it's the interaction that's causing failure...)
apparently you can associate a book with a class twiceâ€¦ And the verification comments should really show up somewhere.

LATER
--------------------------
-Adding a book with both an ISBN 10 and 13 for which one of those ISBNs exists should update the existing entry instead of creating a new one.
-Implement hard start times for intertome (spring, summer, and fall)
-Let books be marked unusable on a global level the first time, and then let individual tomekeepers mark their books usable again at their discretion
-include links to the efollet page for every class?
-automatically send all patrons an email with a list of the books they got
-Specific book checkout as well as general book checkout (checkout of title vs ID number)?
-Auto Semester change? So TOME automatically changes the current semester after a predetermined date...would need to be sometime after class registration
