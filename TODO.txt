NOW
--------------------------
not done with notifications yet... multiple emails fail and don't receive from your own library
Finish documenting functions.php

LATER
--------------------------
-Adding a book with both an ISBN 10 and 13 for which one of those ISBNs exists should update the existing entry instead of creating a new one.
-Implement hard coded start times for intertome (spring, summer, and fall)
-Let books be marked unusable on a global level the first time, and then let individual tomekeepers mark their books usable again at their discretion
-include links to the efollet page for every class?
-automatically send all patrons an email with a list of the books they got
-Specific book checkout as well as general book checkout (checkout of title vs ID number)?
-Auto Semester change? So TOME automatically changes the current semester after a predetermined date...would need to be sometime after class registration
