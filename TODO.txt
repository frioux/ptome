NOW
--------------------------
Checkouts from the reports page are broken
checkins from bookinfo.php are broken
first time login page
sending notifications (I still don't even know what this supposedly does)


LATER
--------------------------
-Implement hard start times for intertome (spring, summer, and fall)
-Let books be marked unusable on a global level the first time, and then let individual tomekeepers mark their books usable again at their discretion
-provide more breakdown on the inventory page
-Allow intertome libraries to be sorted in the dropdown by preference? (I want to reserve from T3, then 2A, then flooders, then G2, ...)?
-include links to the efollet page for every class?
-automatically send all patrons an email with a list of the books they got
-Specific book checkout as well as general book checkout (checkout of title vs ID number)?
-Auto Semester change? So TOME automatically changes the current semester after a predetermined date...would need to be sometime after class registration
-Is there some way we could let books be checked out for the spring particularly even if they're not all back yet? I know just our library as of January 4th
 has ~60 that need returning. I don't know what we'd do about this, but I wonder how many people won't get books because they just don't get returned soon enough...
