NOW
--------------------------
add tome book page doesn't work
add tome book form on the viewClass.php page doesn't work
New checkouts need to include the time they are reserved
The semester report page doesn't show current checkouts from our tomekeepers
The semester report page doesn't show current checkouts from other tomekeepers
first time login page
sending notifications (I still don't even know what this supposedly does)


LATER
--------------------------
-Implement hard start times for intertome (spring, summer, and fall)
-Let books be marked unusable on a global level the first time, and then let individual tomekeepers mark their books usable again at their discretion
-provide more breakdown on the inventory page
-Allow intertome libraries to be sorted in the dropdown by preference? (I want to reserve from T3, then 2A, then flooders, then G2, ...)?
-include links to the efollet page for every class?
-automatically send all patrons an email with a list of the books they got
-Specific book checkout as well as general book checkout (checkout of title vs ID number)?
-Auto Semester change? So TOME automatically changes the current semester after a predetermined date...would need to be sometime after class registration
