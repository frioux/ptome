There should be a way to put books back into TOME
When adding a class, warn about duplicate IDs
Comments on the book (not tome book)
Contact information page (maybe move user admin to here as well)
Don't let the system drop to less than 1 admin user
Make sure a book cannot be removed unless it is checked in
Prompt for current password when changing password
Make it so you can't delete a book from a class unless there aren't any more of those books around, or at least warn about it
investigate form validation...
create a user registry of sorts, by email address - more accurate tracking of who added what and checked out what, also a more effective way to blacklist
More classifications, old edition, optional, etc

Make pretty looking

Amazon.com book pictures?
