<ul>
   <li>
      Take advantage of mandatory floor meetings. Promote TOME at all of them!<br /><br />
   </li>
   <li>
      Use the verses that inspired Shroud and Bolt to create the first TOME:
        <p>
        <strong>Acts 2:44-46</strong><br>
        And all those who had believed were together and had all
        things in common; and they began selling their property and
        possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might
        have need. Day by day continuing with one mind in the
        temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were
        taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of
        heart.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Acts 4:34</strong><br>
        For there was not a needy person among them, for all who
        were owners of land or houses would sell them and bring the
        proceeds of the sales and lay them at the apostles' feet, and
        they would be distributed to each as any had need.<br />
        </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
      Use numbers and dollar figures. <a href="#numbers">Numbers</a>
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Talk to each member of your floor individually.
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
          <p>Put together a team of TOMEgnomes, and give them each a list of people to talk with.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p>Ask for book pledges. People will want to keep their books until
       after finals, but ask them to commit to give the books to TOME as
       soon as they're finished. Take pledges on index cards.
       Catch people before they sell their books back. This is critical!</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>Talk to them every semester; they'll forget.</p>
       </li>
       </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
      Be prepared to counter objections with gentleness and respect.

      <p>
         <strong>“What's in it for me? I'm graduating!”</strong><br>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>This is a chance to invest in the floor that's given a lot to you in other ways.</p>
               </li>
               <li>
                   As Christians, we are to called give without expecting others to return the favor.

       <p>
         <strong>“I need the money.”</strong><br>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>TOME is an investment that pays far better returns than the textbook buyback.<p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  Some people really do need the money. Do not subject them to undue pressure or ridicule.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
       <p>
         <strong>“I want to keep this book.”</strong><br>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <p>You can loan it to TOME and get it back when you graduate.  Meanwhile, your friends get to use it.<p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>Use clever propaganda. Because of the not-so-public nature of TOME (page 11), try to use posters
         that will remind your floor about TOME but won't make much sense to those who don't know what it's
         about (page 12).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>You know your floor better than we do. Market TOME to them!</p>

<p>Once a floor TOMEkeeper has been appointed, you still need several things
to get your floor's TOME up and running.</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <p><strong>Storage space.</strong> We recommend a bookshelf of some sort in the
      TOMEkeeper's room. This has several advantages over a centrally
      located storage location:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <p>The TOMEkeeper needs computer access (to use the database) to
            check books in and out.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>Having the books in the TOMEkeeper's room discourages people
            from just taking books (“It's only for this afternoon, I promise!”),
            forgetting to ever return them, and leaving you with no record of
            where they went.</p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>The TOMEkeeper's room can be locked to prevent theft.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      We recommend boxing the books and locking them the floor's storage
      closet during the summer.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p><strong>A stamp.</strong> The 41 TOME stamps the inside cover of all the books in the
      collection with a custom stamp from stamp-connection.com. It looks
      kind of like this:<br><br>

         <div class="center">
                                    41 TOME<br>
                                   Property of<br>
                                  ___________<br>
                                    Originator<br>
                                  ___________<br>
                                        ID<br>
                                  ___________<br>
         </div><br>
      Of course, you don't have to use this exact method, but it has
      worked well for us. One way or another, each book must be marked
      with its unique database ID number. This is the only way to identify and
      keep track of books.<br>
      The stamp clearly indicates which TOME the book belongs to,
      which is important because of the interTOME system.<br>
      Also, it tells you whether the book is a permanent donation. We put
      TOME under “Property of” if the book stays with us, and the donor's
      name if it does not.
   </li>
   <li>
      <p><strong>A team.</strong> The TOMEkeeper can't do it alone. Finding people to help
      out during the crunch times (beginning and end of the semester) and
      also to help manage other aspects of operation (such as selling the old
      books) is essential to success. Just let us know if we need
      to create user accounts for others on your floor.

<p>Once you have been added to the system, you can access it at the following
URL: <a href="http://dorm41.org/tome">http://dorm41.org/tome</a></p>
<p>Log in with your username and password and you will arrive at the front page
of the TOME system.</p>
<strong>Semesters</strong><br>
<p>Many things in the database revolve around which semester a particular item
is associated with. The system as a whole has a default semester that can
always be seen in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. New entries of
any sort will always default to using this semester. If you wish to
temporarily override the system default semester, you can do so from the
          <a href="<?php print $path; ?>management.php">User and System Management</a> screen.
</p>
<strong>Adding a book to your floor's TOME</strong>
<ol>
   <li>
      Click “Add TOME Book” on the top menu bar
   </li>
   <li>
      Fill in the ISBN from the back of the book
   </li>
   <li>
      Put the donor's name in the Originator field
   </li>
   <li>
      If the donor wants the book back when they graduate, choose which
      semester the book should expire at the end of
   </li>
   <li>
      Add any special comments about the book such as “Front cover has
      water damage”
   </li>
   <li>
      The library should already point to your floor
   </li>
   <li>
      Click “Add TOME Book”
   </li>
   <li>
      You will be redirected to a page containing all the information the
      system has about the book you just added. The most important part of
      this right now is the newly generated book ID number. MARK THE
      BOOK WITH THE ID! And do it right away too, otherwise you'll
      forget and never find the book again.
   </li>
</ol>
<p>The TOME system will not let you add a book unless it knows about the
ISBN beforehand. If you try to add a book TOME does not know about, it
will direct you to a page where information about that book can be filled in.
This same page can also be used by following these instructions:
</p>
<strong>Adding a book to TOME</strong>
<ol>
   <li>
      Click “Add Book” on the top menu bar.
   </li>
   <li>
      Fill in the book information
   </li>
   <li>
      Click “Add Book”
   </li>
</ol>
<strong>Searching</strong>
<p>To search for a book, go to the home page of the TOME system. From there
you can either search by general book information or by class.</p>
<strong>Class Information</strong>
<p>After selecting a class from the home page, you will be taken to a page with
information about that class. Each book for the class has the following
information:</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      General book information
   </li>
   <li>
      Whether the book has been marked as usable
   </li>
   <li>
      When the book's usable status was last verified
   </li>
   <li>
      Who changed the entry last
   </li>
   <li>
      Any comments about the verification (where the information about a
      book's usability came from should be listed here)
   </li>
   <li>
      How many books are available in the library
   </li>
</ul>
<p>When you find new information regarding the usability of books for classes,
please update this page with the latest information. This data will be shared
among all the TOMEs on campus, so with everyone working together, we
should be able to maintain a very accurate listing of what books are needed
for what classes. The only place to find official information from the
university about what books are needed for what classes is at the bookstore's
website: <a href="http://www.bkstr.com/CategoryDisplay/10001-9604-10236-1?demoKey=d">http://www.efollett.com/</a>.</p>
<p>This page also has an area for general comments about the class. Books can
be associated with a class by entering the book's ISBN number into the form
on the bottom of this page.</p>

<strong>Find Orphans</strong>
<p>Keeping books associated with classes is essential. If a book is allowed to
stay in the collection without any record of what class it is for, there's no way
of knowing if it goes out of date or becomes useless. This page will generate
a report showing books that are in any TOME but have not been associated
with a class. Every TOMEkeeper should work to keep this list empty at all
times.</p>

<strong>Find Useless</strong>
<p>Once all of the books have been associated with classes, this page will be
able to generate a report showing books that are no longer useful in any
classes. These books should be sold on Half.com as soon as possible, while
they still have value.</p>

<strong>User Preferences</strong>
<p>Click on the <a href="<?php print $path; ?>management.php">User and System Management</a>
link at the bottom of any page to access the settings for your user account.
From here you can change username (it is case
sensitive), email address, password, and notification preferences.</p>

      <p>These are the policies that 41 has developed for its TOME. You're free

      <p>Everyone on the floor is free to borrow from TOME, whether or not
      they have donated books into the system.</p>

      <p>However, abuse of the system (damaging books, not returning books,
      etc.) will result in a revocation of borrowing privileges.</p>

      <p>Only members of the floor are allowed to borrow from TOME. And
      no, it doesn't count to borrow a book for a friend.</p>

      <p>All first time borrowers need to sign a borrower agreement. See page

<p>We do not believe that we are doing anything even close to wrong legally or
ethically, we are not violating any policies, and we have RD approval for
TOME. However, we still prefer that TOME stay “underground.” The book
store probably wouldn't like us if they knew we existed, and that's a battle
we'd prefer not to fight.</p>

<p>With this in mind, please make it clear to people on your floor that TOME
stays on the floor.</p>
