= Reservations and Checkouts =

Reservations and checkouts should always be discussed in terms of the library, not the book.  So:

* *library_from* - The library that is making the reservation.  The library that the reservation is coming _from_.

* *library_to* - The library that has the book that is being reserved.  The library that the reservation is going _to_.
