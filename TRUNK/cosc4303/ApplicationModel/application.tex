\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose of Document}
The purpose of this document is to specify the TOME system and the application model it uses.

An application is defined as having business logic and presentation elements while an individual component is defined as providing a particular set of services or presentationâ€”but not both. This approach allows for the structure of a modern component based distributed system.

Delivery scheduling and testing issues are also dealt with to ensure that other related applications and components can be developed in parallel.
\subsection{Background}
In December of 2003, several students on Dorm 41 started a system called TOME.  The basic idea is that at the end of the semester, instead of everyone selling their books back to the bookstore, they all donate them to central repository.  Anyone on the floor can then check out whatever books they need free of charge for a semester.

The advantage of having a computer-based system to keep track of all those books is easy to see, and one has been under development ever since the start of TOME.  Since its humble beginnings as a quick solution over Christmas break, the system has grown to well over 3,000 lines of Perl code as well as HTML templates, a well-planned database schema, and significant documentation.  The system not only has comprehensive facilities for tracking books and patrons, but also keeps tabs on what books are used for what classes and other alternatives to purchasing new books.

\section{Application Overview}
\subsection{Scope}
The TOME system is responsible for managing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Books
	\item Book information
	\item Class information
	\item Class-to-book mappings
	\item Book reservations
	\item Book checkouts
\end{itemize}
The TOME system is \textbf{not} responsible for managing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Book acquisition
	\item Book disposal
	\item Selling old books
	\item Any financial activity
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Context}
TOME exists as an independent system with no ties to other databases.  Information from other databases, such as class listings, book information, and book-to-class associations will be used, but not in an automated fashion.
\subsection{Technical Environment}
TOME is a web-based Perl application.  It is intended to be run under the Apache webserver, but any webserver that supports CGI should be capable of running the system.  Template::Toolkit is used to process HTML templates.  PostgreSQL is used as the database backend.  CGI::Application is used as the framework for the system as a whole.
\section{Actors}
\subsection{Actor Diagram}
Figure~\ref{userdiagram} shows an overview of the actors involved in the TOME system and how they interact with each other.  Patrons talk to TOMEkeepers who use the TOME web interface which is based on the TOME database.

\subsection{Business Object Definitions}
\subsubsection{TOME}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.25\textwidth}|p{.75\textwidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & TOME is the core module that processes database requests from the Web Interface.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Attributes} & TOME contains all the methods used for interacting with the database as well as processing template files.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Responsibilities} & TOME is responsible for all database communication, all template processing, all error handling, and any other ``core'' functionality\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Business Rules} & TOME has dependencies on many Perl modules (listed in the install document that can be located by referencing Section~\ref{references}).  These must be installed before TOME will function properly.\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\\

\subsubsection{Database}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.25\textwidth}|p{.75\textwidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & The database is where all the information for TOME is stored.  The current implementation uses PostgreSQL for the database and DBI for all database interactions. \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Attributes} & All TOME data is stored in the database.  See Section~\ref{tomedbsection} for more details. TOME communicates with the database to retrieve, insert, and update all data for the system.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Responsibilities} & The database is responsible for maintaining a consistent state for all data at all times. \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Business Rules} & PostgreSQL must be installed before the system will be functional. \\

\subsubsection{Web Interface}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.25\textwidth}|p{.75\textwidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & The Web Interface forms the connection between the Database and the Templates.  It processes information that TOME retrieves from the Database and sends it to the templates.  It also processes user requests and sends them to TOME.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Attributes} & The Web Interface contains all methods related to interacting with the user via CGI.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Responsibilities} & The Web Interface is responsible for taking any data the user submits, verifying its validity, and submitting it to TOME to be run through the Database.  It is also responsible for taking information that TOME retrieved from the Database and preparing it for the templates to use.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Business Rules} & The Web Interface depends on a number of Perl modules (see the Install document referenced in Section~\ref{references}) and these must be installed before it will be functional.\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Templates}
\begin{tabular}{|p{.25\textwidth}|p{.75\textwidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & Templates form the basis for the look and feel of the web interface.  They do not give any functionality in and of themselves, but are a way to display information that is given by the Web Interface\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Attributes} & Templates have no methods, they only contain the data that determines how information is formatted and displayed.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Responsibilities} & The templates must take information that is given to them by the Web Interface and format it.  In the process of formatting that information, they may request more information through a callback mechanism.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Business Rules} & The templates need to be XHTML and CSS compliant. \\
	\hline

	\textbf{View Title} & Reserve Books\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Number} & ID0004 \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & From the patron information page, classes can be added for that patron.  Once a class information table is built up, the TOMEkeeper can start to reserve books for that semester for the patron.  This process will happen in steps where information about a class and its book associations is presented to the TOMEkeeper, and the TOMEkeeper makes the appropriate selections.  After the selections are made, the books are reserved and the patron is emailed a notification of what all happened.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Scenario References} & UC02.\\

	\hline
	\textbf{View Title} & Add TOME Book\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Number} & ID0005 \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & When a patron desires to add a book, this is the interface that will be shown.  From this page, the TOMEkeeper will enter basic information about the book such as the ISBN and which patron donated the book.  If TOME is unaware of the ISBN, the TOMEkeeper will be presented with a form to fill out the rest of the information about the book.\\

	\hline
	\textbf{Number} & ID0006 \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & If a TOMEkeeper desires to add a class to the system, they will use this interface.  Adding a class is as simple as entering in the class ID and a name for the class.  All class information is added through the interface defined in Section~\ref{modifyclass}.\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Scenario References} & UC04.\\

	\hline
	\textbf{View Title} & Check Book Out\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Number} & ID0007 \\
	\hline
	\textbf{Description} & When it comes time to actually check a physical instance of a book out, this is the interface that will be used.  The TOMEkeeper can either change an existing reservation into a checkout, or they can specify the exact book to be checked out.  After this is accomplished, the Patron can take the book for the semester.\\

\section{Non-Functional Requirements Specification}
The Business Scenario Model only represents part of the full set of requirements.  Although the Business Scenario Model represents the functional requirements that are included in the project, there are many intangible requirements that havenâ€™t been covered.  The purpose of this section is to document the non-functional requirements of TOME.
\subsection{Overview}
The non-functional requirements outlined in this section include the technologies needed to allow TOME to run, capacity planning strategies, and operational parameters.
\subsection{Enabling Technologies}
\subsubsection{Target Hardware and Hardware Interfaces}
TOME is a reasonably lightweight application.  It is targeted to run on any server-class computer.  If the computer is fast enough to run Apache, PostgreSQL, and Perl, it is fast enough for TOME.  Of course, the more users that access the system, the faster and bigger the server will have to be.

\section{Database Structure}
\label{tomedbsection}
The overall structure of the database can be seen in Figure~\ref{tomedb}.  In addition to the structure, there are also triggers that ensure the consistency of the database at all times.
